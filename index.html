        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Batman — a relentless learner, builder, and fighter who refuses to live an average life.
            My journey has been shaped by challenges, discipline, and a vision to constantly grow in every area of life.
            Currently, I am pursuing a Diploma in Computer Engineering at Parul University while also studying Physiotherapy,
            but my ambitions go far beyond academics.
            I am deeply passionate about technology, content creation, trading, dropshipping, real estate, and digital marketing.
            Every single day, I balance my college schedule, workouts, self-study, and personal projects,
            because I believe in building both body and mind.
            My lifestyle is rooted in discipline: waking up early, training hard, walking 8,000+ steps daily, practicing meditation,
            and fueling my body with a clean vegetarian diet while chasing my fitness goals of building muscle and strength.
            I’ve overcome tough battles, including multiple open-heart surgeries as a child, and instead of slowing me down,
            those struggles gave me an unbreakable mindset.
            Inspired by my idol David Goggins, I live by the principles of mental toughness, resilience, and going beyond comfort
            zones. Whether it’s preparing for hackathons, building my ebook-selling website and app, or learning new skills like AI,
            e-commerce, and digital marketing, I give everything I do 100%. My dream is to explore the world, study and settle in
            countries like Canada or Germany, and create businesses that impact thousands of lives.
            I don’t believe in excuses — I believe in work, growth, and becoming the strongest version of myself, physically,
            mentally, and financially. This is not just who I am, this is who I’m becoming: disciplined, focused, and unstoppable.</p>
